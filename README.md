These are the files that I use to make my own personal finance appliaction

some of the scripts require keys or paths that you will have to specify.

I've moved a bunch of Python scripts that compile this data in the Quantified Self repo as this is all off-line analysis that isn't invovled with the data collection application. There is a lot of cool stuff there as well.
